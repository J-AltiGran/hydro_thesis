This project contains the files and structure related to the Master's Thesis "Evaluating Data-Driven Modelling for Groundwater-Surface Water Interactions" by Joaquim Altimiras Granel (2024).

The thesis presents and evaluates a data-driven modelling approach using the Pastas-package in Python 3.11.8. The method is applied to a tunnelling project in Sweden, where leakage to the tunnel risks causing
tunnelling-induced drawdown, which can affect the flow in a stream with high ecological values.

The method consists of two modelling stages:
1.
